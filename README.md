# Hello there, my name is Gavin

## I work @ Maersk and own the strategy for identity and access management.

In the late 90's I found myself administersting users in an NT4 domain. Little did I know this would take me on a journey through Active Directory, MIIS/ILM/FIM/MIM, Azure AD and onwards. Seen all kinds of merger and aquisition scenarios, highly secure architectures, transformation activities. I was at ground zero at Maersk when [notPetya struck in 2017](https://gvnshtn.com/posts/maersk-me-notpetya/), after which I went on adventures and did some stints at risual (now node4), StealthBits (now Netwrix), and then Microsoft. Now back at Maersk having a blast!
